NICE for Short Distance - Good for Its Price
Reviewed in Egypt on 6 May 2022Size: 41Color: gray quatrefoilVerified Purchase
Material is decent considering the price, though If you walk on it for long distance, you will definitely feel some pain, as Its thickness is a bit small. Works perfectly for the beach. But dont' expect to use it all day long walking, as you would feel some pain here.

Seem ok so far
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 July 2022Size: 44.5 EUColor: Crew Navy/Ftwr White/Legend InkVerified Purchase
Only really tried them on, so far but seem good. Even bought another pair as the price was right and I walk/run a lot. I'm always a 12 with Adidas and a similar sports brand; so these fit well. Perhaps a little tight around middle foot but probably with just being new and I could perhaps loosen the laces. I'm not a huge fan of mesh above the toes as you can get holes but the mesh is not as thin as I feared so hopefully ok. Grip seems good and quite lightweight.

La fotografía no es el producto que envía. Me llegaron mal terminadas.
Reviewed in Spain on 6 June 2019Color: Black & WhiteSize: 44 EUVerified Purchase
Corrección. He comprado las mismas en una tienda oficial. Resulta que el logo ya no tiene estrella en la O. Además están las fabricadas en Vietnam, en Indonesia e incluso India. En China también pero por lo visto esas son las de menos calidad. Lo más probable  es que fueran auténticas, pero mal acabadas. Lengüeta más grande, ojales no centrados y tela sobresaliendo, goma de suela de menos calidad y peor terminada. Incluso la lona es distinta.Recomiendo las opiniones del vendedor gestionado por Amazon. El mío bajo sus valoraciones notablemente en el último mesLas zapatillas son no se corresponden con la foto, no son de la marca registrada converse a pesar de usar su logotipo y tratan de parecerse al producto autentico pero son obvias las diferencias. Igual lo hacen para que se considere imitación. La peor compra y experiencia como consumidor.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 June 2018Color: Navy BlueSize: 41.5 EUVerified Purchase
Brought these for my son. The style is timeless and if you like it then great. He does and intact so do I. My complaint with Converse is that they basically only last a year with heavy wear, maybe two summers if you are lucky. Fine if someone else is paying! If you have had them before then this won't come as a surprise.

I bought this for my son to replace a similar pair that had worn out. It arrived quickly in perfect condition and in a branded Converse box.They’re made well with good rubberised soles and are comfortable to wear. My son loved his old pair which is why we had to replace it with ‘like for like’ lol. It’ll see him through his many traipses to and from his uni.We’re both very happy with this purchase 😊

Keine Originalware
Reviewed in Germany on 2 April 2018Color: Black & WhiteSize: 42.5 EUVerified Purchase
Keine Originalware, auf der Innenseite der Sohle fehlt das R für Registered Trademark beim Converse Schriftzug. Schade das man darauf nicht hinweist. Die Sohle löst sich, wenn man sich zu oft hinkniet (ich arbeite im Kindergarten) der Stoff bleicht weiterhin nach kurzer Zeit insbesondere an der Klebekante zwischen Ferse und Zehen aus, ohne das die Schuhe je in der Waschmaschine landeten. Kurzum einfach ein ziemlich billiges Imitat, im Prinzip sollte man Strafanzeige wegen Produktpiraterie erstatten. Tja und nach zwei Monaten und einer Wäsche löst sich die Sohle. Die Schuhe sind der letzte Ramsch, eigentlich sollte man Strafanzeige wegen Markenpiraterie und Betrug erstatten. Siehe Fotos, einmal hier bestellt, einmal im Converse Store!

benchan5.0 out of 5 stars
An u me table pair of jogging shoes for around £30
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 October 2021Size: 9Color: WHITE/WHITEVerified Purchase
For some inexplicable reasons Amazon had sent me the wrong size (half size too small). However this turned out to be a blessing as the pair actually fit my feet perfectly.I have always been a fan of ASICS since I was a kid living in Japan. It is good to see this brand of shoes getting the recognition they deserve, abroad these days.The gel cushioning in these shoes are excellent and have been wearing them for my daily 5k jog without any issues. The grip seems reasonably well as I have not slipped running up wet grassy hills yet.

Comfortable but the laces have been reduced in length to save money and are now only just enough to use- another 2cm would have made them easier to tie!

Great to wear as house-shoes
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 December 2021Size: 45.5 EUColor: BlackVerified Purchase
I bought these Skechers to wear as house-shoes. Most of our home has hard floors and I was finding that standard slippers didn't offer enough cushioning, so I have been using these instead. They fit well, with enough room  in the front even for my relatively wide feet and the sizing is as I had hoped. They are quite well made too, and I like the level of support that they offer underfoot.

Miss Alison Hobbs1.0 out of 5 stars
Not like the quality sketchers I usually buy
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 September 2022Verified Purchase
I usually buy size 8.5 sketchers trainers. I am used to the quality feel of Sketchers. I bought a size 9 of these as there was no 8.5 option.  The sole was plastic-like and slippery. The opening  where you put your foot through had no give at all, so was painful to put on shoes even though these are bigger than what I usually buy.  They do not feel at all like the quality I expect from Skechers. I wouldn't waste money on these.  The cheap price lured me in but I regret purchasing these.  I'll be sending them back. I can't understand how there are so many positive reviews.

Very comfortable, not sure how long they'll last
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 November 2022Verified Purchase
I bought these for work, which means being on my feet about 8h per day. They were very comfortable immediately with no break in period. after about 14 work days, a hole has formed in the inside padding, which is probably to be expected, although my previous similar skechers (style 232047) lasted longer before anything went wrong.

They're slip-on Skechers
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 September 2022Size: 45.5 EUColor: BlackVerified Purchase
If you're new to Skechers, they're not cheap but they fit well.They're very comfortable, lightweight and reasonably long lasting.They can be washed in the washing machine and are generally practical in most situations.If you're not new to Skechers, you already know all this.

Pier Luigi4.0 out of 5 stars
ideale per questa stagione
Reviewed in Italy 🇮🇹 on 2 January 2022Verified Purchase
Per essere una scarpa autunno inverno la trovo leggera e confortevole anche da nuova.Ho fortunatamente preso 1/2 numero in più perchè ho il piede largo e la scarpa tende a fasciare un po' stretto, va benissimo, molto limitato il periodo di rodaggio  e adesso anche i 10.000 passi su asfalto non mi affaticano i piedi.Non ridete per le distanza magari breve ma io ho  80 anni.Ho qualche dubbio sulla durata del battistrada, non  sono tasselli importanti  e  mi sembrano destinati ad una vita non troppo lunga rispetto a scarpe da ginnastica di altra marca famosa che  uso in estate.Se dureranno il giusto le ricomprerò.

I saw these trainers and was immediately taken by their stylish looks, having purchased other Skechers products I knew that these trainers would be comfortable and these did not disappoint. I have worn these trainers for several comfortable hours and as a result, went out and bought another pair. I am really happy with this purchase.
